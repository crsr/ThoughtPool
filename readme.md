## Description

ThoughtPool is a car pooling application for ThoughtWorkers.

## Requires the following CLI tools installed globally:

npm
gulp
mongod   

## Download the Repo and do the following
npm install

# Usage

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB, if you haven't already.

2. If you don't have gulp installed globally, run npm install -g gulp (may need to prefix the command with sudo).

3. cd into the project directory.

4. Make sure you don't have an active mongod process running locally. Run npm run db to create the database and Ctrl+C to stop it.

5. Run npm run dev (or npm run db, gulp and npm start in three Terminal tabs) and start fooling around with the source and the webpage.
